<h1 id="diseasecontrolefficacyrates">Disease control efficacy rates</h1>

<p>Our survey of the scientific literature on preventative practices provided a range of disease-control efficacies (DCEs), which were calculated from multiple experimental trials on different trunk diseases (see table below). DCE is the proportion of pruning wounds which do not become infected as a result of a preventative practice. In the empirical analysis, we use DCEs of 25, 50, and 75%, which reflect the range of natural variation across study years [e.g., DCEs ranging from 29 to 88% for delayed pruning against Phaeoacremonium minimum (Larignon and Dubos, 2000)] or across pathogens [e.g., DCE of 52% for Topsin against Phaeomoniella chlamydospora vs. DCE of 80% against Lasiodiplodia sp. (Rolshausen et al., 2010)]. The high extreme of our range in DCEs is truncated at 75% to reflect that all infections may not arise through pruning wounds. For example, planting material may be infected in the nursery (Gramaje and Armengol, 2011) and, thus, it is unrealistic to assume a practice can prevent 100% of infections.</p>
